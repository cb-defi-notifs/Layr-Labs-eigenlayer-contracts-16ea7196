# EigenDA Contracts Technical Specification

## EigenDA Overview
See the introduction of the [DataLayr Technical Documentation](https://hackmd.io/VXNjJL3iS5W85UxB-mD3VQ) for an introduction. This doc also contains relevant technical details, in addition to outlining the different actors in the system.
EigenDA builts directly on top of [EigenLayer](https://hackmd.io/@layr/eigenlayer-tech-spec).

## Assumptions
We proceed from the same general assumptions as though outlined in the [EigenLayer technical specification](https://hackmd.io/@layr/eigenlayer-tech-spec). The most relevant assumption for EigenDA is the **Honest Watcher Assumption**.
