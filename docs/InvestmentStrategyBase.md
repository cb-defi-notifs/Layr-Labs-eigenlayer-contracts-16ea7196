The InvestmentStrategyBase is a simple, basic, "do-nothing" InvestmentStrategy that holds a single underlying token and returns it on withdrawals. It implements minimal versions of the `IInvestmentStrategy` functions, and is designed to be inerhited by more complex investment strategies, which can then override its functions as necessary.
